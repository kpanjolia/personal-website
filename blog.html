								<h3>The Untapped Potential of AI in Business Performance Optimization</h3>
								<p>
									On a sunny, chilly November afternoon, I shared a conversation on the second floor
									of the Illini Bookstore with a few of my peers from TM 261 and a representative from
									Caterpillar, Inc. My weekly lecture for TM (Technology & Management) 261 includes an
									optional lunch with the guest speakers after they have presented in our lecture hall.
									Over a sandwich and cookie, I discussed with the representative about the use of AI in
									idea generation in professional teams, which was the topic for that week. As the
									representative spoke about his work at Caterpillar, he mentioned that he was actually
									developing a fascinating internal tool to help gauge the lifetime of Caterpillar’s
									machinery. With his team, they had collected substantial data about approximately when
									a machine needs to be repaired or replaced, utilizing specific metrics such as the
									amount of fluid in the machine. After obtaining all this data, they realized they could
									use this data to create a generative AI model that assists machine users in predicting
									when the machine will need to be repaired. The team cleaned the data, then fed all of it
									and their machine specs into the LLM to train it on Caterpillar’s machines specifically. They then used RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to enhance the accuracy of the model and make the reports it responded with more usable. The representative was very excited when talking about this model, and he was amazed when the responses started coming back from the LLM. He looks forward to shipping the model to the sales team so they can strategically make the calls to customers about when to come in to repair their machinery. When I spoke with the representative, he stated that this model is going into production internally at the end of this year and will be used starting next year.
								</p>
								<p>
									The representative’s story made me think about other uses of software similar to the LLM Caterpillar is creating to determine when a machine needs to be repaired and the lifetime of the machinery. My first thought was immediately about the automobile industry and all the times I saw a “Service Due” symbol on the dashboard of my car. If car retailers used a model similar Caterpillar’s and trained it on data specific to their models, they could make more accurate predictions about when a car needs to be serviced, or when specific parts may need to be replaced. Based on metrics such as the yearly mileage of the car, retailers and manufacturers could determine how often the car needs to be serviced, and could reduce the amount of time in between services for users who may not need it as often, which would reduce the workload for the servicing employees and improve overall business operations. Car companies would be able to better use their resources and focus their attention on customers who may need their cars serviced more often.
								</p>
								<p>
									I then extrapolated this thought and pondered more general applications of software such as Caterpillar’s generative AI model. This use case of AI could be applied to almost any industry because at its core, it is about analyzing a business operation and utilizing those analytics to improve the operation, making a positive impact on the company. One example is retail and inventory management. An LLM could be trained on seasonal sales patterns, market data, and general trends to determine when certain products will be more in demand and when they will not sell as much. Based on the LLM output, companies will be able to optimize their inventory and reduce waste, leading to better profit margins and, in the case of the food industry, a more environmentally-friendly operation. 
								</p>
								<p>
									I strongly believe this performance optimization use case of AI should be explored more thoroughly, since it has immense potential to be greatly beneficial for companies across many industries. By exploring and implementing such models, businesses can unlock new opportunities for growth and sustainability. As I reflect on that lunch at the Illini Bookstore, I’m excited to see what comes next in the world of AI-driven innovation.
